Experimental CLR interface to libcouchbase

See the ReadMe in `LCouchbase` for more information.

The solution comes with a sample application (which is basically a "Hello World" application).

Since this does depend on libcouchbase, you will need to download that DLL.
Note that libcouchbase is a "Native" DLL - so in other words, make sure you have the version
appropriate for your platform.

You may want to adjust the _Preprocessor Search Path_ as well as the _Linker search path_ to locate
the proper header files and .lib files.
